"""Explicit platform/core callback ordering for the audited target vLLM API.

Importing this package is side-effect free.  The dispatcher calls
``register_platform_core_callbacks`` after the exact import coordinator is
installed; callbacks then run immediately for already-loaded exact targets or
after the first successful load of an as-yet-unloaded target.
